//Copy your assertArraysEqual and eqArrays functions into this new file.
//Implement middle which will take in an array and return the middle-most element(s) of the given array.
//For arrays with one or two elements, there is no middle. Return an empty array.
        //middle([1]) // => []
        //middle([1, 2]) // => []
//For arrays with odd number of elements, an array containing a single middle element should be returned.
        //middle([1, 2, 3]) // => [2]
        //middle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) // => [3]
//For arrays with an even number of elements, an array containing the two elements in the middle should be returned
        //middle([1, 2, 3, 4]) // => [2, 3]
        //middle([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) // => [3, 4]
//Write test assertions for the various scenarios with middle
//We can and should use the assertArraysEqual function for testing our new function. That's why we brought it in here to begin with.
//Due to the copy/pasted assertion functions, your test code will indeed take up a big chunk of the file. The flow of it should look like this:
